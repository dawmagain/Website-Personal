        <h3>Designer üñ•Ô∏è Developer üñ•Ô∏è Analyst</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-desk">I have been a developer for about one year and a computer analyst for about 9 years. I started debugging, building and installing software on computer systems. I then grew an interest in building websites and
          creating ideas I had in my mind. Now I have the experience of creating systems and how they work thus giving me interest in working on the overall concept of mastering something new.</p>

        <h3>Coding Challenge</h3>
        <p class="coding-text">The first time I actually looked at the code in a browser window was revelatory for me. Here was the internet in the internet‚Äôs own voice! I didn‚Äôt understand most of it, but I could pick out snippets of words and
          phrases that looked familiar. There were a few font names that I recognized, and I understood pixel sizes more or less. The rest of it was alien to me. Here was the language my computer spoke, or so I thought. If you‚Äôre planning on learning
          to code, it‚Äôs worth thinking through the mechanics of coding. Knowing what exactly is happening when you code, what it means when we say someone is coding, what the difference is between coding and programming, what languages you may end up
          coding in, and how to get started coding, will help you be a better coder.</p>
